This is a code to simulate the dynamics of dumbbell-shaped colloidal particles
near the non-penetrable wall. It uses the Pychastic package for stochastic differential equations solving. To effectively describe particle's orientation, it employs the algorithm of Evensen et al. (2008). The particle's mobility matrix was found with HYDROMULTIPOLE code and further approximated with the methods presented in Lisicki et al. (2016). The code attempts to recreate the experiment of Verweij et al. (2021). The comprehensive description can be found at github.com/kxmalz/master-thesis.

To run the code, open the VS notebook (.ipynb).
